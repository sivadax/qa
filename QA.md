## what is the difference between graph API and GraphQL API

A **Graph API** is a **REST-style API** that exposes data organized as a graph (nodes and edges), e.g., Facebook’s Graph API, which uses HTTP endpoints like `/users/{id}/friends`. It’s still REST but models relationships between entities.

A **GraphQL API** is a **query language-based API** where clients define exactly what data they want in a single request. It’s schema-driven, flexible, and not limited to REST principles.

**In short:**

* **Graph API** → REST API over graph data.
* **GraphQL API** → Query-based API with flexible data retrieval.
